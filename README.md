# DSWorkflowTemplate: A Data Science Project Template

Welcome to DSWorkflowTemplate, a comprehensive template designed to streamline data science projects from inception to deployment. This template encapsulates best practices in data management, analysis, and modeling, ensuring that your projects are not only efficient but also scalable and collaborative.

## Purpose

The **DSWorkflowTemplate** template aims to:

- Provide a standardized project structure that facilitates data management, analysis, and modeling.
- Enhance collaboration among data scientists by maintaining a clear and common directory structure and workflow.
- Simplify the process of transitioning from data exploration to production-ready models.
- Encourage best practices in code and data documentation, improving readability and maintainability.

## Project Structure

The template organizes the project into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

```
DSWorkflowTemplate/
│
├── data/
│   ├── raw/                  # Store immutable raw data files here.
│   ├── interim/              # Intermediate data modifications.
│   ├── processed/            # Final datasets ready for modeling.
│   └── external/             # Data from third-party sources.

├── environment.yml           # Reproducible analysis environment.
├── .gitignore                # Specifies intentionally untracked files.
└── README.md                 # Project overview and setup instructions.
```

## Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Start by cleaning your data in `data/raw` and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the data to understand its characteristics and uncover any patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Develop features that are useful for predictive modeling.
4. **Model Training:** Train your models using the processed and engineered features.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of your models using appropriate metrics.

## Utilizing Utility Functions

In the future, I plan to incorporate a set of utility functions to streamline common data science tasks, such as data validation, feature extraction, and model evaluation. These utilities will be housed in the `src/` directory. This section will serve as a hub for enhancing productivity and ensuring consistency across projects.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it. (you can use Miniconda)
3. Install the required dependencies.
    - using `environment.yml`:
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    - Or pip install:
    ```
    pip install notebook pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn xgboost tqdm
    ```
4. Navigate through the notebook templates in the `notebooks/` directory to start your project.
